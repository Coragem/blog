In early October the 2nd edition of Webmaker Brasil Work Weekend happened at Mel & Panaggio’s home, and once again I was very welcomed by them, since they have adopted me as part of their awesome family. We also had new people coming to our community: Ikaros and Paulo. Welcome aboard! O/

We also had remote participation of Rodrigo Waters and Cynthia Pereira, thanks guys! (+1 [appear.in](https://appear.in/webmaker-br))

In the [first edition](https://brazil.etherpad.mozilla.org/i-webmaker-brasil-work-weekend) of this home event, we planned and discussed ideas for the [Maker Week Party SP](https://coragem.github.io/blog/maker-party-week-sp/) and how we can help our community of webmakers in Brazil grow strong.

In this second meeting we took the opportunity to talk about post-event Maker Party and what we can do in the upcoming workshops. What to improve? And where? What kinds of activities are cool and productive?

Raniere and Panaggio played a few games of [Code Castles](https://coragem.github.io/blog/2nd-day-of-maker-party-week-sp-grandparents-and-the-web/) for debugging and tried to improve the game. I just watched and commented how I play during the weekends of workshops that I regularly do in Guarujá.

All the improvements applied to the game are documented on the [pad](https://brazil.etherpad.mozilla.org/code-castles-remix).

We also discussed several ideas for [**Movimento Mozilla**](https://old.etherpad-mozilla.org/movimento-mozilla) in 2015; news of this action coming soon ;-)

And finally, the Mel’s blog has born!!! :D Look here: [http://melc.at](http://melc.at)

Details of what we discussed and tested can be easily read on the [pad](https://brazil.etherpad.mozilla.org/webmaker-2-work-weekend).

Go go webmakers!

Coragem
