Organize a full week of workshops was frantic and certainly a totally different experience from other events that I’ve organized and attended.

Come here and take a look at this amazing week numbers:

- Maker Party Week São Paulo had the participation of approximately **400 people**.
- There were more than **30 workshops**. And more than 20 of them occurred in a single day.
- The workshops accounted **more than 50 hours** of activities.
- The week occurred in **3 cities** and **4 different locations**.
- Each mentor traveled more than **350km** of road transport to carry out workshops, including even a bus flat tire.
- There were more than **20 trips** in urban bus and **10 channel crossings** of Santos – Guarujá; totaling over **20 hours** of urban travel.
- Approximately **100kg** of material was used in the workshops.
- The more experienced attendee was **87** and the youngest was just **2**.
- Our photo booth accounted more than **200 photographs**.
- More than **400 creations** were produced (between Thimble and bags).
- Several people attended more than one workshop.

A volunteer life is not easy, always facing a tight budget, saving and trying to invest our time and money consciously. It was hard work took all the materials to the workshops on buses and ferries all week. Besides weight, we unintentionally fumbled passenger flow. But it’s okay, it was for a good cause :P

## Challenges

The first major challenge was to synchronize our activities, each school/station/forum/group has its own calendar; we scheduled and rescheduled some dates, and in the end we managed to close the week \o/

The second challenge was to carry the material to each place we planned to take a little bit of Maker Party.

The third challenge was to overcome tiredness and any kind of discouragement. I was a little discouraged with the robbery attempt when I was returning home on foot. Mel and Panaggio were staying at ~1.5km from my house. Thursday was our craziest day: there were ~20 workshops on the same day, we finished the afternoon activities, and when we got time to dinner, it was nearly midnight. Public transportation during the day in Guarujá is horrible, and during the night it is **nonexistent**. Seriously!

So, to not stay in the bus stop waiting for a bus for two hours, I decided to go home on foot, after all it was not so far away. In the end, the bad guys bluffed, I also bluffed and got out of them shouting louder – I learned to bluff playing card games with Mel and Panaggio :P

And not, I’m not a crazy guy, I don’t recommend bluff in these situations, I only did it because I can’t accept to be robbed without some sort of threat, such as automatic weapons; don’t bring a blade, because if so, I will laugh hahahahaha!

## Mission Accomplished
