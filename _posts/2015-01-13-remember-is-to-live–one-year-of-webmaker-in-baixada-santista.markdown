In November 2013, after I got in touch with Webmaker during MozSummit in Toronto, I decided to explore the project and make a pilot phase in my city.

The [pilot](https://events.webmaker.org/events/3054) phase began on November 6th, 2013 and ended on December 13th, 2013. There were 84 hours of activities. From Monday to Thursday, from 08 to 11 in the morning. Two groups of 22 webmakers (with a total of 44 webmakers). We produced [~100 makes](https://webmaker.org/pt-br/search?type=all&q=Brasil), learned a lot and had a great time during our workshop mornings.

We ended the pilot phase (or zero phase) with our first Maker Party with a sense of: what now? we want more! View [photos here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/_coragem/sets/72157638755424694/).

In January 2014 I lectured along with Panaggio in the [7th edition of Campus Party](http://campuse.ro/resource/43617/view.cp). I took the opportunity to talk about how I met Webmaker and how much I had fun and learned new things exploring the [Web Literacy Standard](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy) and playing with the project tools.

Before I got really involved in this project, I haven’t understood it very well. I knew [Marcelo Araldi](https://twitter.com/araldimarcelo) was doing some workshops in Passo Fundo – RS and [Rodrigo Padula](https://twitter.com/rodrigopadula) in Rio de Janeiro. I talked to them about their activities and asked what they were doing because I also wanted to help. After several exchanged emails and conversations on IRC, I got excited even more.

To kick things off in the workshops here in Baixada Santista I had LOTS of help from [Amira Dhalla](https://twitter.com/amirad) and especially from my friend [José Amilcar](mailto:kankrezinho@gmail.com). Amilcar is involved in all activities / events / actions here in Baixada, he doesn’t like to show up and writing in mailing lists, but when needed, he is always available for a coffee and help me plan the next step .

In March, Panaggio invited me to speak about Webmaker with him during [Appmaker Party](https://reps.mozilla.org/e/webmaker-appmaker-workshop/). Panaggio was a volunteer in the development of Appmaker and got his hands dirty, I mean, in the code in the first versions of the tool and helped the event guys to create web components. I introduced myself as a volunteer, talked about the Webmaker and showed what our caiçara community was up hehehe :P

In April as usual I helped organize the [Flisol Santos 2014](http://flisolsantos.com.br/programacao) with my friends from [GCCSD](http://www.gccsd.com.br/), I made a presentation of Webmaker in general, showed the tools, the Web Literacy Standard and what our webmakers community that was born a short time was planning for the rest of the year.

In May Panaggio, Mel and I submitted 5 activities for the [FISL 15](http://papers.softwarelivre.org/papers_ng/public/new_grid?day=7): 1 workshop about Appmaker, +1 workshop about Thimble, X-Ray Goggles and Popcorn Maker, +1 workshop about Code Castles, +1 talk about Appmaker and +1 talk about Webmaker. And all were accepted! :D

As well as the Campus Party, the Fisl is a well run event, we barely had time to eat lunch, but in the end everything worked out. I quite liked the opportunity to talk about Webmaker and Web Literacy in Espaço Paulo Freire with teachers from various schools from Rio Grande do Sul.

It was also in May that Amilcar and I started the first workshops at UNAERP University Campus Guarujá. After much discussion and presentations the University agreed to adopt Webmaker in the official grid of the social and voluntary sector service throughout the year on Saturday mornings.

Still in May we organized the [Pizzamaker](https://reps.mozilla.org/e/pizzamaker/), we gathered our caiçara community of webmakers to celebrate and remember the success of the project pilot phase in Baixada. We took advantage of the meeting to record video testimonials of folks talking what they thought about the workshops. Watch the [videos here](https://coragem.github.io/blog/pizza-maker-party/).

In June, the brazuca community of webmakers organized the [1st Webmaker Brasil Work Weekend in Campinas](https://brazil.etherpad.mozilla.org/i-webmaker-brasil-work-weekend). Participants were: [Panaggio](https://twitter.com/panaggio), [Mel](https://twitter.com/mel__), [Raniere](http://blog.rgaiacs.com/), [Marcus Saad](https://twitter.com/mvnsaad) and me. At our first meeting we planned that [Maker Party Week SP](https://coragem.github.io/blog/maker-party-week-sp/) and helped personally [Geraldo](https://twitter.com/geraldobarros_) in his first workshop at [CRJ](http://www.campinas.sp.gov.br/governo/cidadania-assistencia-e-inclusao-social/juventude-conectada.php) in Campinas.

In August Mel, Panaggio and I did the Maker Party Week São Paulo, it was the best experience I ever had organizing workshops and I’m proud of the work we did. The results of this funny week are well [documented here](https://coragem.github.io/blog/an-adventure-in-caicaras-and-campineiras-lands/).

In September we did the Maker Party Guarujá [[1](https://events.webmaker.org/events/5485)-[2](https://events.webmaker.org/events/5486)-[3](https://events.webmaker.org/events/5487)-[4](https://events.webmaker.org/events/5488)-[5](https://events.webmaker.org/events/5489)-[6](https://events.webmaker.org/events/5490)] \o/

October was the month for the [2nd edition of Webmaker Brasil Work Weekend](https://coragem.github.io/blog/ii-webmaker-brasil-work-weekend/). This time we had new people as Ikaros and Paulo, welcome aboard o/. We focused on discussing the activities post Maker Party Week SP, the errors we committed and what we did right and how to improve the quality of the workshops.

And finally in December we finished with style the workshops in UNAERP. See the [photos here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/webmakerbrasil/sets/72157649639619866/).

Since the pilot phase in November 2013 until December 2014 the community has been working day after day, we had activities for ALL the months of the year, I thank all who are helping our webmakers community to grow strong in Brazil.

Go go webmakers! o/
