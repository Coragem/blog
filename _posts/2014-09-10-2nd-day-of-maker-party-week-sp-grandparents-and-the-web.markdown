On the second day of Maker Party Week SP, we did a different activity. Our workshop took place at Estação da Cidadania de Santos, and the public at large majority were elders (or as they call themselves, ~vovonautas~) that often attend the Estação.

At Estação there aren’t computers for general use, so we bet on an offline activity such as the card game Code Castles, to teach a little bit of HTML and the web.

It had already been some time that us (Mel, Panaggio and I) wanted to play with Code Castles, so we thought: “All grandpa like card games, right?” - WRONG!

When we asked: “Hey guys, who likes to play cards?”. We heard a huge collective “I DON’T”, only two or three people said “I like”. It was a #megafail for us at that moment hahahaha

Even they are not big fans of card games, they accepted to know the game.

## Code Castles

The game is the brainchild of [Chad Sansing](https://twitter.com/chadsansing) to teach nesting, opening, closing and kinship of tags. Using a deck of cards, we must build fortifications, which must be equipped and loaded with ammunition. This dynamics is the ludic part of the game, which shows the levels of kinship between the elements, and the positions they should occupy within the code.

The game is under [Creative Commons (CC-BY) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) and can be shared and modified; Chad Sansing encourages and gives tips to players to remix the elements and rules of the game.

## Enjoy!

For those who said that didn’t like card games, the ~vovonautas~  played for 3 hours hahahaha.

I took my laptop and using [X-Ray Goggles](https://goggles.webmaker.org/) we saw the game concepts on a web page structure :]

In the evening Panaggio talked about Internet security, a topic that was raised by the public itself.

We also talked about [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/) philosophy, Santos Dumont, knowledge sharing, and life stories. We spent an afternoon of fun learning together!
