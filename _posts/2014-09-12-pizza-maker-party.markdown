On May 18th, the webmakers caiçara community in Baixada Santista celebrated the success of the Webmaker pilot in Guarujá.

At least 40 teenagers aged 10-15 attended the phase zero  of the project; it was 84 hours of learning by doing with these folks.

Makes can be easily found by searching tags Guaruja and Brasil on webmaker.org.

The group took the opportunity during the party to chat about a free, open and helpful web to everyone.

We recorded some testimonials from those who attended the workshops. The idea of the video was a surprise to the class, without fully ready texts and totally out of the heads of the guys.

The videos are in Portuguese, but you can activate English subtitles.
