In the wake of the [Mozilla’s global campaign](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/events) to teach the web, from July 29th to August 4th, [Mel](https://twitter.com/mel__), [Panaggio](https://twitter.com/panaggio) and I organized the Maker Party Week SP in the cities of Santos, Guarujá and Campinas.
We did a whole week of workshops in different places in Baixada Santista and Campinas. At first, we had in mind 12 workshops during 7 days, but in the end we got to the incredible number of 25 workshops. How so? Yeah, I also wonder how we achieved this number and how nobody freaked out.

Hey Coragem, explain it better. – So, what happened was that Microcamp (a computer school) decided to release ALL of their classes (~240 students) on that sunny Thursday to attend the Maker Party, what at least doubled the number of activities that day. Our team talked among ourselves (Mel, Panaggio and I) and decided to accept this challenge. Each of us was responsible for one or two classes at time, but it only worked in the morning, after lunch the number of students tripled and we had to join in and seperate sometimes.

Mel gave the idea to customize ecological bags before presenting Webmaker tools.
 
> But what customizing bags  has to do with creating  for the web?

Before folks started using Thimble and X-Ray Goggles, we asked if they were capable of creating something in ~real life~. A few said yes and many others thought they weren’t able to create anything.

We are talking about creation in the sense of doing something with their own hands (hand crafting). – For example, I make a great pasta and lemon pie :P

Remixing bags was a way to awake the creativity of the crowd and let everyone at ease to create, and understand that no one needs to be a Van Gogh to draw a [Pikachu](https://www.flickr.com/photos/webmakerbrasil/14844080265/) in a ecobag. Likewise, you don’t have to be a professional baker to make bread or a professional car mechanic to change a flat tire. **You don’t need to be a professional web developer or a wizard level 99 in Ragnarok to understand how the web works - or to make your own things on the web.**

At the end of the first part of the workshop, we collected the remixed bags, and asked again if everyone thought themselves to be capable of creating something. This time, almost everybody said YES! \o/

Following the workshop, we asked if everybody was now prepared to create something with the web. And we invited them to get their hands dirty, I mean … on the keyboard.

We used the Thimble to learn about HTML elements and teach the basic tags: _html, head, title, body, img, h1, h2, h3, a, p, em, footer, section_; and also a bit of CSS _properties: background-color, position, color, text-align, margin, text-shadow, font-family, font-size, padding-top, border_.

With the X-Ray Goggles we saw the structure of some web pages so that each of the attendees could remix on their own way.

My favorite meme page is this [here](https://coragem.makes.org/thimble/LTQzNTQyMDkyOA==/meme-maker-coragem).

All pages made during the week can be found by searching the tag MakerPartyWeekSP on webmaker.org.
Photos of all days are on [Flickr Webmaker Brasil community](https://www.flickr.com/photos/webmakerbrasil) :D

In the rhythm of celebration, at the end of the workshop, we handed all the bags with a lot of surprise candy inside \o/

P.S: I want to thank all the teachers from Microcamp Guarujá who helped us take care of so many people at once.
