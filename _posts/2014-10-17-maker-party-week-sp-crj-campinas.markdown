The last day of this incredible week of workshops happened at CRJ Campinas. We had known this place months ago when we attended a workshop with [Geraldo](https://twitter.com/geraldobarros_)’s guys from [Juventude Conectada](http://www.campinas.sp.gov.br/governo/cidadania-assistencia-e-inclusao-social/juventude-conectada.php) (former Jovem.com).

Different from the [first workshop](http://universidadedaweb.com/mozilla-brasil-oficina-de-criatividade-web/) they attended, where they knew a little about Mozilla and the Webmaker, this time we focused on a tool, the [Thimble](https://thimble.webmaker.org/).

The activities countryside were not much different than those on the coastland; we made bags and then learned some HTML and CSS to create web pages.

We were also reinforced by [Raniere](http://blog.rgaiacs.com/), our friend who helped us a lot. I think the more people helping, the workshops are better; it is difficult to give individual attention to each attendees, and when we have more mentors, the quality of the workshop increases greatly.

We used the gifts we still had, like bottons, stickers, lanyards and tattoos to make a Quiz about HTML elements and CSS properties. The crowd was excited and had watched the workshop carefully; the gifts weren’t enough at the end hahaha.

All pages made during the week can be found by searching the tag MakerPartyWeekSP on webmaker.org.
