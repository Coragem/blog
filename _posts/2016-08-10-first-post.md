# The Internet is for everybody

At the 5th day of Maker Party Week SP, we had Ricardo Motta’s notable presence during the 5/6/7/8(?) workshop at Sesc Santos. Ricardo is famous at Sesc because he is autist and illiterate, and even with difficulties, it is not a hindrance for him to participate in most of the activities that happened there.

Common scenario of people who takes part in our workshops are those already literate in Portuguese, so we just ~need~ to literate them about the web.

Ricardo appeared at LabLivre and stayed there, observing the crowd having fun and making customized bags as the first part of the workshop. I asked him if he would like to take part, and with a smile on his face, he accepted. I took sometime to realize who was him and that he would need to provide him special care. Nobody warned me about his case, I just noticed he wasn’t able to write at the second part of the workshop, when we started to remix webpages using Thimble. If I was by myself I’m sure that I wouldn’t be able to include Ricardo in the workshop; I thank very much Panaggio and Mel for being there with me and took care the of the other attendees while I was meeting a new friend and I was showing him the utilities of the our beloved Internet.

Ricardo already knows how to read, and this was one of the most important skills he used in order to learn a little bit about the web. I can’t say that I taught him how to write and make webpages with HTML and CSS in about 4 hours. It is impossible! Hahaha.

To teach him the basic tags as: html, body, head, p, h1, a… and the CSS properties: color, font-size, background-color… I needed to be his pilot instructor and Ricardo the learning pilot. I showed him what is possible to do with a little of HTML and CSS and he told me how he would like his webpage to look like.

I think that the ideal would be to let him write the whole code and I would only guide him through the good practices. I swear I tried it, but we didn’t have enough time and he couldn’t write it all, so I had to take control of the keyboard at the end of the workshop. I really wanted to talk about privacy and security, but it would be too much information at once and we hadn’t enough time. I hope I can come back to Sesc Santos to resume the work we started with all the guys from the other days and with the happy Ricardo; this buddy can enjoy a lot of things from Internet and improve his communication capacity.

Ricardo Motta’s makes, 55 years old:

- Um pouquinho sobre mim :D
- E mais um pouquinho sobre mim…


P.S: I want to thank my friend and professor José Amilcar aka Zé for donating a little of their time to teach English to me, thanks bro!
